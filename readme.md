# STOCK MANAGEMENT BACKEND

The backend of this project was created using Express.js, Node.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, JWT, and Token technologies. The primary objective of my project is to provide a robust solution for data management and business logic, catering to both developers and end-users. Leveraging the fast performance of Node.js and Express.js, combined with the data storage flexibility of SQL and MongoDB, results in a versatile architecture. The project has been designed with a strong focus on security and scalability considerations.
